# Your Obligation to Know the Law

In short, government officers—which, of course, includes professionals in criminal justice disciplines—are not only "[**expected to know the law**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]" _but **also**_ "**presumed to know the law**." This obligation includes both the criminal laws that an officer enforces and the laws governing an officer's conduct.

put in presumed section - [_Harlow v. Fitzgerald_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13486920831186038844\&q=457+U.S.+800\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#p818), 457 U.S. 800, 819 (1982); [_Frank v. Relin_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16677712238944402551\&q=e+Frank+v.+Relin,+1+F.3d+1317,+1328+\(2d+Cir.1993\)+\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#p1328), 1 F. 3d 1317, 1328 (2d Cir. 1993)

Being "presumed to know the law" means that regardless of whether a criminal justice professional actually knows the law in a particular circumstances, their actions are treated as if they do. [_McCann v. Coughlin_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2697923939660132614\&q=698+F.2d+112\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#p124), 698 F.2d 112, 124 (2d Cir. 1983); Putnum & Ferris, 691 (1992).

"However, police officers are presumed to know the law, and are expected to remain current on changing legal developments."\[\*][^2]                  &#x20;

Department members shall "obey local ordinances and state and federal laws" , mpd core value [3.05](https://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/mpdAuthors/PDFs/CodeOfConduct2.pdf)



See also, e.g., Milwaukee Police Department Standard Operating Procedure [085.00](https://city.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/mpdAuthors/SOP/085-CITIZENCONTACTSFIELDINTERVIEWSSEARCHANDSEIZURE.pdf), expressing the need to be familiar with "the U.S. Constitution, statutory authority and applicable case law."

; this obligation not only includes the [codified law](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] but also the judicial cases interpreting the codified law. Thus, future and current criminal justice professionals must understand the case law that governs their conduct.

"police officers must know the law." -- know the law and affirm defenses: " _if the police officer is aware of the facts and circumstances establishing an affirmative defense to defiant trespass,_ he or she should know that a crime is not being committed."

Moreover, in addition to knowing the law and general legal principles, officers are expected to know how they apply "in similar or anlagous circumstances." [_Rios v. Lane_,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13791240393501120844\&q=812+F.2d+1032\&hl=en\&as_sdt=6,50#p1040) 812 F.2d 1032, 1040 (7th Cir. 1987).

To fully grasp the legal responsibilities of criminal justice professionals, it's crucial to understand both the statutory and case law. This involves analyzing past judicial decisions and how they interpret codified laws. Proper legal reasoning can lead to more effective decision-making and reduce risks for the professionals and their organizations.



This class is not law school, and it is not about turning students into lawyers. _**But**_ this class may feel like a "mini-law school" because how lawyers think and how criminal justice professionals need to think are not as different as many people might believe (i.e., to be most effective and minimize legal risk to themselves and their employers). Thus, to help understand case law, the course starts with understanding legal reasoning.
